# CNN OC-SVM: Using anomoly detection on input for image classifiers.
> This module is designed for extending image classifiers so images that are not part of any classes can be checked against exemplars and flagged as potentially problematic before final inference. **Note that this is mostly an exploratory repository, your results in the real world might differ!**


Check out the development branches! They will have much more interesting stuff than master for at least the next 24 hours. 

## Install

**Currently on hold until minimum viable product is reached!**
`pip install cnn_oc_svm`

## How to use

```
print('Hello world, we\'ll be running soon!')
```

    Hello world, we'll be running soon!
